# Hugging Face Cache / Model Files
# The transformer models are downloaded and cached here. DO NOT upload these.
# Typically, models are saved in the user's home directory under .cache/huggingface/
# but if you ran the code, they might be saved locally in a sub-directory too.
# The `app.py` script will re-download them on any new machine.
